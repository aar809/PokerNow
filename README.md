## PokerNow: Data Wrangling and EDA

This notebook will look through the analysis of log files from a typical PokerNow session with my friends.


I enjoy the analytical and statistical elements of the game, which is complemented nicely by the psychological warfare, making for a perfect tactical game to test your wits amongst friends. On top of this, during the lockdown, PokerNow naturally became a go-to platform for my friends and I to gather online and banter.

Needless to say, this analysis was a lot of fun to make, as it coincided with my interests in both poker and data. 
The intended result was to gain a deeper insight into how each player played, rather than simply gauging off of win/loss amounts.
