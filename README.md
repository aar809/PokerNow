## PokerNow: Data Wrangling and EDA

This notebook will look through the analysis of the actual log file from a typical PokerNow session with my friends.


Poker is a game of decision making in the face of incomplete information. It is a game of statistics, but also psychological strategizing, making a fun tactical game to test your wits amongst friends. During the lockdown, PokerNow naturally became a go-to platform for my friends and me to gather online and play.

Needless to say, this analysis was a lot of fun to make, as it coincided with my interests in both poker and data. 
The intended result was to gain a deeper insight into how each player played, rather than simply gauging off of win/loss amounts.
